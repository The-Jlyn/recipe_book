Directions: Preheat oven to 350 °F. Combine the peaches, 1 cup sugar, and water in a saucepan and mix well. Bring to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat. Put the butter in a 3-quart baking dish and place in oven to melt. Mix remaining 1 cup sugar, flour, and milk slowly to prevent clumping. Pour mixture over melted butter. Do not stir. Spoon fruit on top, gently pouring in syrup. Sprinkle top with ground cinnamon, if using. Batter will rise to top during baking. Bake for 30 to 45 minutes. To serve, scoop onto a plate and serve with your choice of whipped cream or vanilla ice cream."),

        child: Text("Ingredients:  Salmon fillets – main ingredient. Rich in omega 3 and great source of protein! Salt and pepper – so the salmon isn’t bland. Olive oil – to help brown the salmon and prevent sticking. Chicken broth – to create a sauce. White wine will work great too. Fresh lemon – for bright flavor. It’s the perfect complement to salmon. Garlic – for another layer of flavor. Butter – for richness. Honey – to balance out the tartness of the lemon. Parsley – for a nice colorful garnish. How to Cook Salmon in a Pan: Let salmon rest at room temperature briefly, so it cooks evenly. Make the lemon butter sauce. In a small saucepan, melt 1 tsp butter over medium heat. Add garlic and sauté 1 minute. Pour in chicken broth and lemon juice. Let sauce simmer until it has reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Stir in butter and honey, set sauce aside. Dab both sides of salmon dry with paper towels, season with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add salmon and cook until done to your liking. Plate salmon and drizzle each serving generously with lemon butter sauce, sprinkle with parsley."),
